Requirements for a Parking Lot

-> There should be multiple floors in parking Lot
-> There should be multiple gates
-> There should be a parking attendant at each gate
-> There will be entry and exit gates
    -> We can understand that the processing of multiple things that are performed at the time of entry and exit will happen here
-> Cost can designed as per will
    -> We should implement this in some greater global variable so that when needed, could be changed easily
-> Parking space should facilitate cars of all types
    -> Space optimization is expected
-> We should display on entry how many cars are there already, and how much free space for each type of car (Hetch-back, SUV, Sedan etc.)
