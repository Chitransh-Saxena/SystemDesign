Low Level Design is a component level design process.
    -> Once we have a high level design, then we create this low level design
    -> Based on this, the task is divided in several sprints and separate JIRA stories

    -> So, based on the requirements, we put together a diagram (not always)
        -> The purpose of this diagram is to show a clear picture of each entity (class)
        -> It also has to show the relationship among those entities
        -> The details like one-on-one and many-to-one will be mapped here

    -> Once we have this clear picture of a requirement into a class diagram with all the actors and scenarios
        -> It really makes it easy to code.
        -> Image 1 in this document shows how a very basic class diagram looks like
