How two devices connected to internet locate and communicate with each other?

    -> Simply put, web browsers interact each other with IP addresses.
    -> DNS translates the domain names into the IP address

-> How it works?
    -> When a user wants to load a web-page, a translation must occur, from what the user types (something.com) to a concrete IP address (0.0.1.2)
    -> This process is further granulated by 4 different hardware components

    1. User types in the domain name, and the query reaches the DNS recursive resolver (another server)
    2. The resolver then queries the DNS rootnameserver
        -> It is a server which kind of keeps an index of which domain name resolves to what IP.
        -> NOTE: This is not the final step, it just gives the index
    3. The rootnameserver responds with the address of Top Level Domain name like (.com, .org ) etc.
    4. The resolver than (Step 1) then queries to .com or .org TLD
    5. Now, the root nameserver responds with the IP address to the DNS Recursive resolver
    6. This IP is then returned to the browsers
    7. Now the browser makes a http request to that IP
    8. The server at that IP returns a web-page to be rendered by the client browser

-> What is a DNS Resolver?
    -> A DNS Resolver is basically the first step which our browser requests to with queries

-> What is DNS Caching?
    -> By the name of caching we understand that the results would be stored in some temporary storage so that the look up and query resolution happens faster
    
    -> Browser level caching
        -> Basically browsers cache the DNS records till some extent
        -> Check this in your browser - chrome://net-internals/#dns.
    
    -> OS Level DNS caching
        -> Local persistence layer also keeps track of DNS records
        -> Still need clarity on this
