Today most computers interact through TCP/IP
    -> TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
    -> IP - Internet Protocol

-> These basically set some standard rules to allow computers to communicate on any network

How they work?
    -> IP is responsible for figuring out the IP to which the data is sent
    -> TCP is actually responsible for sending the data
