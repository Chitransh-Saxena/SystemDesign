-> REST stands for Representional State Transfer
    -> It is an architecture style for designing loosely coupled applications over HTTP
    -> These are majorly used in web-development
    -> REST does not impose any rules. It just gives design guidelines

Here are the few architectural constraints which REST wants to impose

-> Uniform Interface
    -> For all the APIs the interface should be similar, so that if a developer is familar to one, he can take similar approach for others
    -> Could be a UI based or commandline based
-> Client-server
    -> Client and server applications should be loosely coupled, so that they can evolve independetly
-> Stateless
    -> The server shall not store any result or any state about the HTTP request that the client made
    -> Caching is a different thing though

-> Cachable
    -> Resources must be cachable in order to provide faster results to the clients
-> Layered System
    -> It can be considered as a distributed system, but where the work is distributed as well
    -> API could be deployed on server A, disk could be there on server B, and some other activities could be there on server C.

-> REST and RESTful webservices
    -> REST is not HTTP
    -> REST is not a protocol
    -> It is simply a guideline
        -> It says, if you follow these guidelines, you will be able to build a optimum and scalable system and web apps
    -> Web services which follow these guidelines are called RESTful
