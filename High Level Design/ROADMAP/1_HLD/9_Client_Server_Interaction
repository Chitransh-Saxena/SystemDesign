How do clients and servers interact?

-> REST APIs
    -> A simple API, which adheres to REST standards
        -> Stateless, no storing of data
        -> Possible caching
        -> Uniform Interface
            -> For all APIs, interface should be similar, makes it easy for development
        -> Distributed System
            -> API could be deployed on Server A, disk on server B, request processed on server C'
        -> Clients and Servers should be loosely coupled

-> REST Endpoint
    -> The url at which the request has to go

-> REST API acts as a single gateway
    -> Consider, what is gonna happen
    -> A user is gonna hit the URL, and thats all.
        -> We have our REST endpoint getting hit with a request
        -> How do we process this request, where we process this request. It depends on us
