Webserver

* It is a peice of software that is serving the content
* So, how does webserver actually work?
    * It "Listens"
    * on a "Port"
    * For a "request"
    * this request is sent via a "Transport protocol"
    * and returns a "response"
    * containing the requested "resource/content"

* Listen
    * Webserver is basically like a "waiter / server" which is waiting to serve us with some request
    * How does this happen?
        * Well, when someone approaches the webserver via some host_ip:port_number, we reach the webserver
        * Once we reach, webserver is ready to serve us
        * So, in our request, we usually provide the request paramters along with host_ip and port_number.

* Port
    * This port is basically one of the network ports that is provided by the operating system on which the webserver is running on
    * One webserver could be listening to 1 or many ports
        * I need to learn how to make this happen
        * Is it some sort of local machine scaling?
        * Most probably, it could be a different web sever of the same type
    
* Request
    * The way we communicate over the web is based on "HTTP"
    * So, each communication is basically an assembly of a HTTP request and response
    * A standard "request" contains the host_ip:port_number/request_paramters
    * But HTTP is a lot more than this, it contains information about what kind of request you are sending, what kind of response you need, and a lot more, including cookies and stuff
    * Know about HTTP here
