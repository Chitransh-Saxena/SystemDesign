Stack - 
    -> Used by 1 thread of execution
    -> Stack memory of 1 thread cannot be accessed by another thread
    -> Follows LIFO manner
        -> Once out of stack, object eligible for garbage collection
    -> Contains local variables, primitive variables and references to objects

Heap
    -> Heap memory is used by all parts of execution
    -> Shared among threads
    -> Contains actual data stored in any object, whereas the reference of these objects are stored in stack
