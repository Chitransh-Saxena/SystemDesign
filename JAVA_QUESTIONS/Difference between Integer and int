Integer is a Wrapper Class


In Java, we can use variables like
    -> int, float, char etc.
    -> These are not objects, they are data types, and rather primitive data types

-> For every primitive varible data type, we have a Class
    -> int => Integer
    -> float => float
    -> char => Character

-> We can simply do
    Integer i = 10;
    Or we can do Integer i = new Integer(5);
    or we can do int i = 5;

    -> But since Java is a purely object oriented language it is a good practise to use Integer 'i' as it is an object and not a variable now.


-> If we have a varible like 
    -> int i = 5;
    -> And we define a new Integer object, we can do something like this
    -> Integer x = new Integer(i);          // This is called boxing
    -> Integer x = i;                       // This is autoboxing

    -> Similarly we have unboxing and auto-unboxing

-> Also, the new frameworks and data structures implement Integer and not int (they implement the wrapper class and not the variable type)
    -> ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();         // This is valid
    -> ArrayList<int> list = new ArrayList<>();             // This is invalid
